This is the final work of my workmanagement system. After the iteration following things had been changed: 
1.The color of the UI(User can change the color through coding) Because the color of the original prototype 
may be too old-fashion and too simple. The new color make more sense of work and advanced. 
2.The layout of the home page and the function of pulling into the quadrants User can decide the importance 
and emergency level when adding the task. It will be automatically put into the right area.
